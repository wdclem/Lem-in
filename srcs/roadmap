main
> parse_input - save_map save the map in 2d array in the struct, can already calculate how many room there is for further malloc;
after map and ant are run
I have map save in info->str
need to save room and validate them >>> rooms.c probably gonna use linked list so can add and remove without having to reindex.
need to save links and validate them >>> links.c

Once all is checked :

I should have the amount of room and link
save a list of room
